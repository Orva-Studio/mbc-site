# 5 Essential Tips for Creating Developer Content That Actually Converts

Creating content for developers is different from any other audience. Developers are skeptical, time-pressed, and have a built-in BS detector that can spot marketing fluff from miles away. After growing my audience to millions of developers across platforms, here are the five essential tips that made all the difference.

## 1. Show, Don't Just Tell

Developers want to see code in action. Instead of talking about how amazing your framework is, show it solving a real problem. Screen recordings of actual coding sessions perform 10x better than talking head videos.

```javascript
// Bad: Just talking about React hooks
// Good: Actually building something with hooks
const useCounter = (initialValue = 0) => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(initialValue);
  
  const increment = () => setCount(prev => prev + 1);
  const decrement = () => setCount(prev => prev - 1);
  const reset = () => setCount(initialValue);
  
  return { count, increment, decrement, reset };
};
```

## 2. Keep It Brutally Practical

Every piece of content should answer the question: "How can I use this in my actual work?" Theoretical concepts are fine, but developers gravitate toward content that solves their immediate problems.

**Instead of:** "Understanding Design Patterns"  
**Try:** "3 Design Patterns That Will Save You Hours in React Development"

## 3. Respect Their Intelligence (But Explain the Context)

Developers are smart, but they might not know the context around your specific domain. Skip the basic programming concepts, but do explain the business or domain-specific reasoning behind your choices.

## 4. Make It Scannable

Developers often consume content while context-switching between tasks. Use:

- Clear headings and subheadings
- Code snippets with proper syntax highlighting
- Bullet points for key takeaways
- Timestamps for video content

## 5. Address Common Gotchas

The most valuable content often comes from sharing the mistakes you made and how to avoid them. Developers love learning from others' pain points.

### Example: Common React Performance Pitfall

```javascript
// ❌ This will cause unnecessary re-renders
const Component = () => {
  const handleClick = () => {
    // handler logic
  };
  
  return <Button onClick={handleClick} />;
};

// ✅ This is optimized
const Component = () => {
  const handleClick = useCallback(() => {
    // handler logic
  }, []);
  
  return <Button onClick={handleClick} />;
};
```

## The Secret Ingredient: Authenticity

Here's what really separates great developer content from the rest: authenticity. Share your genuine experiences, including the failures. Developers can tell when you've actually used the tools you're talking about versus when you're just reading from a marketing brief.
