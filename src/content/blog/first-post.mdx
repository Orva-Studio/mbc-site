I've been making videos for a really long time because I like to teach. I like to learn new things and teach them, particularly when it comes to code.

It's been something I've done on the side, but almost 2 years ago I quit my job and decided to do it full time. I may write a blog post going into detail on that, but for now you can hear me explain it in my episode of the [Voxgig podcast](https://www.voxgig.com/podcast/richard-bray-developer-advocate-betterstack).

It's amazing how good you can become at something if it's your full time job. My gear, presentation skills, and content creation systems have all greatly improved. Not just for video but also long and short form writing. And since I like sharing what I've learned, I wanted to share that too.

This is why **Make Better Content** exists. To share what I'm learning about all forms of content creation, specifically for developer-focused content, but I think anyone can benefit. There will also be a huge section on AI, how to use it to create content and how to use it in general. I honestly think it's not hype, not going away, and can help you make better content.

I also plan to share and create tools I use to make content, prompts, scripts, and apps. You don't have to be a coder to benefit, but because I am, there will be some content geared to that. Don't be shocked if you see a code block in future blog posts.

I'm excited to see where this goes. If you want to join me on this journey, feel free to add your email below or [follow me on X](https://x.com/RichOBray), I tweet regularly. I read every DM and email, so don't be a stranger.
